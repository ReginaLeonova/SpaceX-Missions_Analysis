# 🚀 SpaceX Launch Success Analysis

## 🎯 Goal
Investigate the factors that affect the success of SpaceX launches and analyse the relationship between **payload mass**, **launch site**, and other variables that may influence mission outcomes.  
The analysis was conducted using the *SpaceX-Missions* dataset.

## 🧠 Hypothesis
> *The success rate of SpaceX launches is higher for smaller payloads than for larger payloads.*

## 📊 Findings
The initial hypothesis cannot be fully confirmed.  
The analysis shows that **payload weight alone** has only a weak influence on the success rate.  
However, when combined with **payload type**, it plays a more significant role — certain combinations are more strongly associated with successful missions.

Overall, the results suggest that **improvements over time** and **careful planning around specific payload characteristics** are key contributors to SpaceX’s increasing success rate in recent years.  
This insight can guide future launch preparations, helping SpaceX focus on payload types and configurations most aligned with mission success.

> ⚠️ **Limitations:**  
> The dataset covers only an 11-year period and has a relatively small sample size.  
> Future analyses including a broader timeline and more recent data would provide a clearer and more reliable understanding of the factors influencing mission success.

## 📈 Dashboard Insights
Analysis through Tableau supports similar conclusions:

- Smaller payloads may show slightly higher success rates.  
- The dominant factor behind SpaceX’s improving performance is **technological advancement** and **accumulated experience** over time.  
- **Vehicle design evolution and mission optimisation**, rather than payload weight alone, are the main contributors to SpaceX’s growing reliability.
